## TODO
- Sorting + OrderMethod
- Control
- FileManager
- HistoryManager + LogEvent - add every event
- StorageManager
- UI
- 
- TEST EVERYTHING
Because until this very moment, I build everything with faith that it will work just fine, no testing in fact. Funny, isn't it?
No, really it should work, it isn't anything new, but things in TODO mostly are.
